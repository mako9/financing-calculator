# 🏠 Financing Calculator

An interactive Python-based application for calculating and visualizing property financing with detailed interest curve diagrams and amortization schedules.

## 📋 Overview

The Financing Calculator is a professional tool for analyzing loan financing for property purchases. With interactive input fields and comprehensive visualizations, financial planners can model realistic scenarios and understand how interest and amortization develop over the credit period.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎯 Core Calculations
- **Loan Amount**: Automatically calculated from purchase price minus equity
- **Monthly & Annual Rates**: Based on initial amortization and interest rate
- **Interest Calculations**: Year-by-year breakdown of interest charges
- **Amortization Schedule**: Detailed tracking of debt reduction
- **Remaining Debt**: Calculation after any number of years

### 📊 Visualizations

The application provides 5 specialized diagrams for comprehensive financial analysis:

1. **Remaining Debt Development**: Shows the progression of decreasing debt as an area chart
2. **Interest vs. Amortization**: Grouped bar chart showing yearly split between interest and principal
3. **Cost Distribution**: Pie chart visualizing the ratio of total amortization to total interest
4. **⭐ Interest Curve**: Specialized diagram showing how annual interest charges decrease over time
5. **Cumulative Development**: Shows cumulative progression of amortization and interest over the years

### 📈 Tables & Data

- **Detailed Amortization Schedule**: Year-by-year table with all relevant metrics
- **Overview Cards**: Quick view of the most important metrics
- **Metric Boxes**: Grouped presentation of input, rate, and total information

### ⬇️ Export
- **CSV Export**: Amortization schedule for Excel and other spreadsheet applications
- **JSON Export**: Structured data for programmatic processing

## 🚀 Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python Package Manager)

### Step-by-Step Installation

#### 1. Create Virtual Environment (recommended)
```bash
cd /Users/mario/Projekte/Private/financing-calculator
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
# or for Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs:

**💰 Affordability**
- Calculate how many years to pay off the loan based on household income
- Input: Net household income and percentage you want to spend on payments (5-40%)
- Output: Affordable monthly payment, years to payoff, total interest, remaining debt
- Reverse calculation: Given income constraints, find the timeline instead of fixed years
- Perfect for: Income-based financing decisions and affordability assessment
